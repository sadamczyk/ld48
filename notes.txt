Theme: Deeper and Deeper

Ideas:
#1 Stardew Valley Mines / 2D Zelda Dungeon Copy
- Top-Down 2D
- Levels, where you start from outside and move further inside (possibly through maze like structure / or like a spiral)
- Entry into new level in the middle, which opens new level and repeat
	- Try camera effect, where it zooms into the level trigger and then opens new level as if you entered / jumped/ climbed down ?
- Play around with lighting effects, make light darker every level, add smaller light sources (torches etc.) and eventually small permanent/temporary lighting items (flashlight etc.)
- Boulders / collision items in levels (maybe movable?)
- Water puddles, Waterfall, little unwalkable pond
- mining equipment, aesthetic
- Enemies: Slimes, Bats, Rats etc.
- Build mechanics around light?
	- Enemies that mess with the light sources (flickering, turning off temporarily)
	- Enemies that are only visible in certain lighting conditions (or for example only if lighting is off!)
		- Turn off light, so you can see the enemy, but now you can't see the environment anymore etc.


#2
- Snake like game, where you move through a spiral/maze from the outside to the inside
- Forced constant movement like snake
- Enemies/collisions in the way
- Shoot tongue/fire from head to kill enemies
- pickups on the ground, giving health, protection, attack powerups
- Snake / Aztec theme for everything?

#3
- Side-view plattformer, where you start at top and keep dropping further down

#4
- Water theme? where you keep diving further down

ToDos:

Core mechanics, that are most necessary for working / somewhat playable game
- Basic music / SFX (credits!)
- movement of enemies / different types/colors; stupid with set movement pattern; smart, will move towards player
- improve/add player / enemy models, weapons, armor etc.; more enemies

Would be very good to have:
- only activate/open goal on trigger? button or when all enemies dead?
- Camera that follows player smoothly
- invincibility frame after player takes dmg (+ blinking/flashing animation)
- Simple animations for player / enemies -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txtNjkSqOyw
- Make up to 5 (10?) levels
- Hit marker for projectiles
- Health/item pickups/powerups
- Lighting, reduce lighting intensity on every new level; experiment with different light sources etc. -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkgGyO9VG54
	- depending on if i can make that "light" theme work, i might need different graphical assets!
- Reduce bouncing on collision (might just depend on the used colliders / shapes?)
- Try nicer font from Kenneys Pack for Texts, because Arial looks pretty garbage, or use C:\Users\seba1\Downloads\Assets\Kenney Game Assets (version 41)\2D assets\Tappy Plane\PNG\Letters

Nice to have for later:
- Pause screen etc. -> https://leetdev.io/unity-vr-development/day-22-creating-game-end-state-game-animation
- Enemy ideas:
	- Enemy that is the only light source in a level, and gets darker the less it has, therefore making the fight more difficult over time? (Could be a (mini-)boss?)	
- points/gold, including pickups/treasures etc.?
- Different sprite depending on equipped items
- Traps that dmg you/mess with you in some way (turn light off, remove item etc.)
- Health bar shown as a candle/light that becomes dimmer and dimmer the less health you have
